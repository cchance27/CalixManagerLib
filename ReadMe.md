# CalixManager

This project is a rudementary implementation to calling Calix NetConf for basic lookups and procedures.

I'll be slowly expanding this as i need to add additional features. Theres probably a netconf library typed
manner to build out the XML but i had the code preformatted from a previous JS project so copy and modifying
was easier to implement.
